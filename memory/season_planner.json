I've retrieved some valuable information:\n\n**Athlete Profile:**\n*   Age: 23 years old\n*   Sex: Male\n*   Weight: 75.6 kg\n*   FTP: 290 W\n*   VO2 Max: I was unable to retrieve your VO2 Max from the system at this time.\n\n**Your Main Goal:**\n*   Race Name: Arlberg Giro\n*   Race Date: 2025-08-02\n*   Distance: 150 km\n*   Race Type: Cycling (appears to be a Gran Fondo/Road Race given the distance and elevation)\n*   Specific Goals: Achieve an FTP of 330W, a weight of 74kg, complete the race in 4 hours, and maintain 320W on climbs.\n\nTo finalize your high-level Season Macrocycle, I still need a few crucial pieces of information:\n\n1.  **Current Fatigue Level:** My tools show your stress level as \"None\" and couldn't retrieve training readiness. Could you please describe your current fatigue level (e.g., fresh, slightly fatigued, very fatigued, recovering from a hard block)?\n2.  **Average Weekly Training Hours (last 6 weeks):** The system does not provide a direct way to calculate your average weekly hours. Could you please tell me what your average weekly training hours have been over the past 6 weeks?\n3.  **Maximum Hours per Week:** What is the maximum number of hours you can realistically commit to training per week? This is vital for designing a sustainable and effective plan.\n\nOnce I have these details, I can construct your personalized macrocycle!"
