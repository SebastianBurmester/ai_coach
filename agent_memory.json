Are you looking to integrate running as a form of cross-training for your cycling race, or do you have a separate running goal in mind?\n\nTo give you the best advice, could you tell me a bit about your current running experience? For example, when was your last run?"

You covered 18.47 km in 25.7 minutes, which indicates a good level of power and speed.\n\nWhile this is a great effort, a single virtual ride doesn't fully reflect your endurance for a 150km cycling race. To prepare for such a long distance, we'll need to focus on building your sustained aerobic fitness.\n\nHow do you feel about incorporating some longer, steady-state rides into your plan? And how does this virtual ride performance tie into your running goals? Are you looking to improve your speed or endurance in running as well?"
